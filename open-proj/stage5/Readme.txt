To compile and run the codes:
python3 CarbonfootprintresourcesReshaping.py
python3 Classifiers_on_Individual.py
pyhton3 Classifiers_on_resources.py
python3 Clustering_Resources.py
python3 Handlingthedataset.py
python3 Handlingtheindividualdataset.py
python3 Individual_Clustering.py
python3 validation_individuals.py
python3 validation_resources.py

The datasets have also been submitted along with the code and the validation has 
been done on the datasets.Thus the dataset has been handled by dropping the columns with
NaN values and validation has been done on it.The performance of the Machine Learning
methods for the datasets have been analyzed.
